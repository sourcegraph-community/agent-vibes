## High-level summary
The diff touches a single file, `app/dashboard-v2/page.tsx`.

Main themes  
1. All `<RssSection … />` instances have been replaced with static “Coming soon …” placeholders.  
2. The associated `RssSection` import was deleted.  
3. A new in-page section “Build Crew Discussions” plus a corresponding navbar link were introduced.  
4. The explanatory footer note about “Miniflux RSS + AI summaries” was removed.  
5. Minor cosmetic tweaks: consistent bold/large font for “Coming soon …” placeholders.

Net effect: the dashboard temporarily **removes live RSS-driven content** and replaces it with stubs, while adding one extra stub section.

## Tour of changes (recommended review order)

1. Start with the **navigation bar block (lines ~60-70)**.  
   Understanding how the new “Build Crew Discussions” link is wired is crucial because it drives the next changes (new section id, active state handling, scroll spy, etc.).

2. Then review the **new “Build Crew” section (lines ~225-240)** to confirm id/title consistency and styling parity with existing sections.

3. Finally, scan the **large block (lines ~300-360)** where each `RssSection` component is replaced by static HTML. That reveals the functional rollback and any side-effects (removed note, unused component).

## File level review

### `app/dashboard-v2/page.tsx`

Changes made
• Removed `import RssSection …`  
• Added navbar `<a>` element for `#build-crew`.  
• Inserted new section markup for “Build Crew Discussions.”  
• Replaced three `<RssSection … />` blocks (Product Updates, Research Papers, Perspective Pieces) with static placeholders.  
• Adjusted a Timeline placeholder message.  
• Deleted the Miniflux integration note at the end of the Highlights section.

Code review

Correctness / consistency
1. Active-section tracking  
   – The file already tracks `activeSection` via state & scroll listeners (not shown in diff). Make sure the code that enumerates section ids now includes `'build-crew'`, otherwise the nav pill will never receive/lose the `.active` class during scroll.  
   – Likewise, the array that drives scroll-to-section logic (if any) must be updated.

2. Navigation link
   – `href="#build-crew"` correctly matches the new section id.  
   – Consider adding `aria-current="page"` or similar when active for accessibility.

3. Placeholder consistency  
   – Re-used `.card` container and `font-bold text-lg text-gray-400` → consistent.  
   – All other placeholder sections follow the same pattern; good visual consistency.

4. Removed `RssSection`  
   – Component is now orphaned. Delete the file or mark as dead code to avoid confusion.  
   – If feature deprecation is temporary, leave a TODO comment or open a tracking issue; otherwise future maintainers won’t know why this was removed.

5. Lost explanatory note  
   – The docs link to the Miniflux integration is valuable context; consider relocating it to the repo’s README or a dedicated “Coming soon” message so users still understand the roadmap.

Performance / efficiency
No impact—logic was removed, so bundle size is marginally smaller.

Security
No new user input or network interaction → no new attack surface.  
Removing dynamic RSS fetching eliminates any potential XSS vectors that might have been introduced via un-sanitized feed content.

Potential improvements / follow-ups
• If scroll-spy code lives in a hard-coded array, update it now to avoid mismatch bugs.  
• Add a central “Under construction” component instead of duplicating the same markup several times; keeps future changes DRY.  
• If the RSS sections are expected to return, consider feature-flagging instead of full removal to make toggling easier.
