## High-level summary
The script that triggers the sentiment–processing job (`scripts/process-sentiments.ts`) has been refactored to optionally run in a self-looping “drain the queue” mode.  
Key additions:

* New Supabase service client is created to count the remaining `pending_sentiment` rows.
* New environment variables  
  * `SENTIMENT_LOOP_ALL` – turns the loop on/off (`true` by default).  
  * `SENTIMENT_LOOP_MAX_RUNS` – safety-cap for number of passes (clamped 1-10 000, default 100).
* Robust parsing / clamping of existing env vars was tightened.
* Extensive logging & several exit-guard conditions were added.

No other files were touched.

## Tour of changes
Start the review at the **new configuration block (lines 10-25)** that introduces the loop flags (`SENTIMENT_LOOP_ALL`, `SENTIMENT_LOOP_MAX_RUNS`) and the Supabase client. This section drives all subsequent logic changes (loop, counting, exit conditions). From there, proceed to the `try` block where the looping algorithm is implemented.

## File level review

### `scripts/process-sentiments.ts`
1. Imports  
   • Added `createSupabaseServiceClient` – implies a dependency on Supabase service-role creds. No changes needed here.

2. Env-var parsing / clamping  
   • `rawRetries` refactor is clearer and prevents NaN from being clamped.  
   • `loopAll` parsing: anything other than the literal string `"false"` (case-insensitive, surrounding spaces trimmed) evaluates to `true`.  
     ‑ Consider also treating `"0"`, `"no"`, `"off"` as false to be more user-friendly.  
   • `maxRuns` clamped to `[1, 10 000]`, default 100 – sensible.

3. Supabase helper `hasPending`  
   • Uses `count:'exact', head:true` ⇒ only metadata is returned, efficient.  
   • Error is converted to exception – good.  
   • `count ?? 0` coverage prevents `null` leakage.  
   • Possible optimisation: create an index on `(status)` in `normalized_tweets` to keep count queries fast on large tables.

4. Non-loop path (`!loopAll`)  
   • Behaviour identical to prior version – straightforward.

5. Looping path  
   • Guard: `runs < maxRuns` protects from infinite loops.  
   • Secondary guard: if a pass processed 0 items *and* items still pending, it warns & aborts, preventing a tight loop due to hidden bug or mis-status rows.  
   • After loop exits, checks again whether items remain; exits with non-zero code if so – keeps CI / cron jobs honest.  
   • Overall logic is solid and side-effect free.

6. Error handling  
   • Fatal errors and job-reported failures correctly cause `process.exit(1)`.  
   • Beware: Unhandled rejection outside of `try` (e.g., inside Supabase’s fetch) would still bubble – consider `process.on('unhandledRejection')`.

7. TypeScript / correctness  
   • All new functions are typed (`Promise<number>` etc.).  
   • No implicit `any`s introduced.  
   • `clamp` usage remained correct.

8. Security considerations  
   • Script now pulls Supabase service keys; ensure `.env.local` / environment is not committed.  
   • No user-supplied input reaches the DB query directly – good.  
   • The script still prints stats but never logs raw tweet content or keys.

9. Performance  
   • Each loop performs **two** network calls: a `count` then the job itself. For thousands of passes this is negligible, but if latency is a concern you could let the job return “remaining” to avoid the extra query.  
   • `maxRuns` upper bound (10 000) ensures resource exhaustion can’t happen accidentally.

10. Style / maintainability  
    • Logging is clean and emoji-labelled; consistent with existing style.  
    • The larger `try` block could be broken into helper functions (`processOnce`, `processLoop`) for testability, but not blocking.

---

Overall the change is well-structured, provides safer automation, and introduces no obvious bugs. My only recommendations are:

1. Expand `loopAll` falsy semantics (`'0', 'no', 'off'`), or document the strict requirement.  
2. Optionally fold the initial `count` into `runSentimentProcessorJob` return signature to halve DB round-trips.  
3. Add `process.on('unhandledRejection', …)` to avoid silent exits on promise leaks.
