## High-level summary  
The change introduces a ‚Äúbrand / product‚Äù dimension to the social-sentiment feature.

1. **BE ‚Äì new API endpoints**  
   ‚Ä¢ `/api/social-sentiment/brands` ‚Äì returns the list of distinct enabled brands/products.  
   ‚Ä¢ `/api/social-sentiment/by-product` ‚Äì returns daily sentiment aggregates filtered by days, language and brands.

2. **BE ‚Äì repository**  
   ‚Ä¢ `DashboardRepository.getProductDailySentiment()` added, mapping to view `vw_product_daily_sentiment`.

3. **FE ‚Äì dashboard widget**  
   ‚Ä¢ `SocialSentiment.tsx` extended with brand filter UI, dynamic colour assignment and a multi-dataset Chart.js line chart.  
   ‚Ä¢ Summary cards now honour either global or brand-filtered data.

No existing files are removed; only additive changes were made.  

## Tour of changes  
Start with `DashboardRepository.getProductDailySentiment()` ‚Äì it defines the contract that both new API routes and the UI rely on. Then review `/api/social-sentiment/by-product/route.ts` to understand request semantics and data shaping. Finally inspect the large React diff (`SocialSentiment.tsx`) where most logic and potential UI issues reside.

## File level review  

### `src/ApifyPipeline/DataAccess/Repositories/DashboardRepository.ts`  
+ Added `ProductDailySentiment` DTO and `getProductDailySentiment()`.

Correctness  
‚Ä¢ Uses column names available in view; mapping looks consistent.  
‚Ä¢ Limit and ordering are applied after filters ‚Äì OK.  
‚Ä¢ When both `limit` and `order` are present Supabase requires `order()` before `limit()` ‚Äì you already do that (good catch).  
‚Ä¢ The query is guarded by try/catch in the caller, but here you throw on error ‚Üí good.

Potential issues / improvements  
1. You default to `limit 30`; for a multi-product request that is tiny (30 rows total, not per product). Consider defaulting to e.g. `30 * (filters.products?.length ?? 1)` or requiring caller to pass `limit`.  
2. Aggregates come back **descending**. Both API and UI regroup by day, so order is irrelevant, but if any future caller relies on sort it may be confusing ‚Äì document it.

Security  
Supabase typed query builder is safe from SQLi; RLS still applies.  

### `app/api/social-sentiment/brands/route.ts`  
Creates server client, fetches brands, returns sorted list.

Correctness  
‚Ä¢ `products.sort()` is locale-unaware; fine for ASCII names but might mis-order international brands.  
‚Ä¢ No pagination needed.

Security / robustness  
‚Ä¢ Endpoint is public unauthenticated ‚Äì confirm that `fetchDistinctEnabledProducts` only returns non-sensitive data.  
‚Ä¢ Consider setting `Cache-Control` headers; this list rarely changes.

### `app/api/social-sentiment/by-product/route.ts`  
Large endpoint that consumes the new repo call.

Correctness & bugs  
1. `days` validation is good, but parsing failure for `days=abc` still gives `NaN`, caught by `Number.isFinite`. üëç  
2. `decodeURIComponent(productsParam)` can throw on malformed input ‚Äì wrap in try/catch or fall back.  
3. `limit` heuristic: `days * 10 * products` (capped at 10 000). That can still be 10 000√óN large JSON; consider streaming or hard cap by row size rather than arbitrary multiple.  
4. Average sentiment score is **unweighted** (simple average of daily averages). If tweet volume per day varies greatly, result will be misleading. Either weight by `totalCount` or rename to `avgDailySentimentScore`.  
5. Summary percentages use posted totals ‚Äì correct.  
6. Returned JSON can be big; gzip is automatic, but you may still hit Vercel 4 MB limit.

Security  
‚Ä¢ Same open endpoint; if sentiment data is sensitive, add auth.  

Performance  
‚Ä¢ One Supabase round-trip; grouping/summary executed in JS ‚Äì fine for ‚â§10 k rows but could be done in SQL for efficiency.

### `app/dashboard-v2/components/SocialSentiment.tsx`  
Largest change.

UI logic  
‚Ä¢ Adds brand filter UI with ‚ÄúAll / Clear‚Äù helpers.  
‚Ä¢ Keeps two data sources: global (`/api/social-sentiment`) and per-product; chooses one for summary and chart.  
‚Ä¢ Dynamically builds datasets: solid line for positives, dashed for negatives, per colourised product.

Correctness / edge cases  
1. **Hook dependencies** ‚Äì `selectedProducts` is a `Set`. The `useCallback` / `useEffect` dependencies will treat every change as different reference (desired) but spreading into array (`Array.from(selectedProducts)`) inside hook can be costly; negligible now.  
2. `brandColor` returns 7-char `#RRGGBB`. You append `FF`/`80`/etc. to form 9-char `#RRGGBBFF`, which is valid in modern browsers but _Chart.js_ on canvas relies on CSS parser (OK on modern Chrome/Firefox). For broader coverage use `rgba()` helper.  
3. When zero brands selected the component shows friendly message ‚Äì good.  
4. Recent social activity still uses global `data`; that might diverge from brand filter. Consider switching to productData when only one product is chosen or disabling the panel.  
5. React key for recent feed uses index; acceptable for static preview rows.  

Performance  
‚Ä¢ Each product selection triggers a full API fetch; acceptable but consider debounce if brands list grows.  
‚Ä¢ Colour palette hashing is deterministic; collisions possible but rare.

Security  
Front-end only.

Accessibility  
Checkboxes / buttons have focus styles via Tailwind default. Good.

### `app/api/social-sentiment/by-product/route.ts` (previous) ‚Äì minor observations  
‚Ä¢ `Math.min(days * 10 * (products?.length || 1), 10000)` risk of 0 when `products` undefined? You default to 1, so OK.  
‚Ä¢ You convert `startDate` to ISO and split at `T` in UI; sending `'YYYY-MM-DD'` is sufficient.

### `app/api/social-sentiment/brands/route.ts`  
No further remarks.

## Overall recommendations  
1. Handle malformed `decodeURIComponent` gracefully.  
2. Weight `avgScore` by tweet count or rename.  
3. Consider caching both new endpoints (`revalidatePath`, `Cache-Control`).  
4. Document that `/api/social-sentiment/by-product` returns **descending** days.  
5. Convert 8-digit hex to `rgba` for wider browser/Chart.js support.  
6. Limit JSON size or offer CSV export if product/timeframe is large.  
7. Optional: unify ‚ÄúRecent Social Activity‚Äù with brand filter to avoid confusion.

With these small fixes the feature looks solid and well-structured.
